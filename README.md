# Property Management APIs

> This is a sample appliacation to showcase the ability to develop REST APIs with Spring boot and Hibernate. It should be considered as a prototype and not a full fledged application. For now, We have included only the requested APIs  

## Getting Started

### Install

This application uses H2 Database for the sake of simplicity so that no additional database servers need to be installed. 

To compile and install these dependencies, type `mvn clean package` in your terminal.


### Credentials:

> For the sake of simplicity, we have created some users with their keys so that the APIs would be accessible only with the keys.

for user `innkeeper`, the key is `pg94l805y4`

for the user `purchaser`, the key is `l8527a5tim`
